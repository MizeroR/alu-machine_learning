# Linear Algebra Utilities in Python

This project provides a collection of Python functions for basic linear algebra operations on matrices and arrays. It leverages both plain Python lists and NumPy arrays to demonstrate matrix manipulations, element-wise operations, slicing, concatenation, and matrix multiplication.

## Features

- Calculate matrix shape for nested Python lists
- Transpose 2D matrices (lists and NumPy arrays)
- Element-wise operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Matrix addition and concatenation along different axes
- Matrix multiplication
- Extraction of submatrices via slicing without loops or conditionals
- Pure Python and NumPy implementations

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy (for the functions dealing with `numpy.ndarray`)

Install NumPy if you don't have it:

```bash
pip install numpy
