# Unsupervised Learning - Clustering

## 📌 Description

This project focuses on implementing clustering algorithms from scratch using **NumPy**, as part of the Machine Learning curriculum.

The objective is to understand the mathematical foundations behind:

- K-means clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
- Hierarchical clustering
